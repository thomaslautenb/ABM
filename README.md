## About the Project
This repository contains the coursework and final assignment for the course. The main objective is to implement and explore agent-based models using Python and the Mesa framework.

### Key Components
- **Base Models**: Initial models used as the foundation for more complex simulations.
- **Final Assignment**: Detailed report and implementation of the final project.
- **Tutorials**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions on using the Mesa framework.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment tools (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thomaslautenb/ABM.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     .\env\Scriptsctivate
     ```
   - On MacOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the models and tutorials.
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the desired notebook and run the cells to see the model in action.
